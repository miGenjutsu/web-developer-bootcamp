## 🙋 What is HTML5?

#### LIVING STANDARD
The HTML standard is a document that
describes how HTML should work.

#### ROLE OF BROWSERS
The standard describes the rules of HTML, but
browsers actually have to do the work and
implement HTML according to those rules.

#### HTML5?
HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard
that defines HTML. It includes new elements
& features for browsers to implement.

## 🪆 InLine / Block Elemets
- Inline elements fit in vertical
alongside other elements

- Block level elements take
up a whole "block" of
space horizontal.

-----

## 🧭 Semantic Markup

Semantic -- relating to meaning
"what purpose or role does that HTML element have?"

----

## 🗃️ Instead of DIVS
use more specific elements like:
```
    <section>
    <article>
    <nav>
    <main>
    <header>
    <footer>
    <aside>
    <summary>
```


## 👓 HTML Entities
WTF IS `&#9824`;

-   Start with an ampersand and
end with a semicolon
-   Used to display reserved
characters, that normally
would be invalid
-   Also used in place of difficult to
type characters
-   The browser interprets them
and renders the correct
character instead.

# 🚀 Exercise 11: Checkerboard Exercise


## 📝 Instruction:
The `index.html` file contains 25 `<div>` elements, each with the class of `square`. Please create a simple checkerboard pattern by making the **even squares black** and the **odd squares red**.  Your result should look like the image below.  Please write your styles in app.css, and do not change any of the styles in `NO_TOUCHING.css` :)

**Please note**: the solution needs to select both the *even* and *odd* squares, changing the background color of the entire board will work visually, but will not pass the exercise parameters.

# 🚀 Exercise 9: Basic Selector Practice


## 📝 Instruction:

It's time to get some practice with the new CSS Selectors we just learned. Without touching any of the starter HTML code in `index.html`, write CSS in `style.css` according to these rules:

- Give all `li` elements the text color `blue`

- Give all elements with the class of `done` the text color `grey`

- Give the element with the id `clear` a `red` background and `white` text

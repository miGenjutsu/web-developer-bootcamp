## 📝 Markup Language

HTML is a Markup Language

```
    "Make this part bold"
    "Make this part a link"
    "Make this a paragraph"
```

## 🔖 HTML Elements
To write HTML, we pick from a set of standard
Elements that all browsers recognize

Common Elements include:
```
    <p> element - represents a paragraph of text
    <h1> element - represents the main header on a page
    <img> element - embeds an image
    <form> element - represents a form
```

## 🏷️ HTML Tags
We create elements by writing tags.
Most (but not all) elements consist of an
opening and closing tag

```
    <p>I am a paragraph</p>
```

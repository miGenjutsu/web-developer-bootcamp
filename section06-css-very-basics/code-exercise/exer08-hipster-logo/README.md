# 🚀 Exercise 8: Hipster Logo


## 📝 Instruction:

### Hipster Logo Exercise

I'm opening up a very hip artisanal vodka company called Purple Grain. Please help complete my incredibly ugly logo. Style the `<h1>` with the following styles:

- uppercase all the letters, without touching the html! (note: you weren't taught how to do this, you will need to flex your googling skills)

- set the font-family to be 'monospace'

- center align the text

- set the font weight to 100

- make the text size 40px

- set spacing between letters to 20px

- add a wavy plum underline (plum is the color) - I can't test this, but make sure it looks like the image!

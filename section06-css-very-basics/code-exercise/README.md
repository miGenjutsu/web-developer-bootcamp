## ðŸ™‹ WHAT IS CSS?

CSS is a language for describing how
documents are presented visually - how they
are arranged and styled.

## ðŸ™‹ WHAT DOES IT STAND FOR?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. We'll
cover the "cascading" part in a bit; don't worry about it for now!

## ðŸ™† THERE'S A LOT!

CSS is very easy to get the hang of, but it can
be intimidating because of how many
properties we can manipulate.

## CSS RULES
(almost) everything you do in CSS

follows this basic pattern:
``` code
    selector {
        property: value;
    }
```

Make all `<h1>` elements purple
``` code
    h1 {
        color: purple;
    }
```
